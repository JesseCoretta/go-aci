## Advanced Examples

Practically every `type`, function, method defined within this package includes usable examples, which are available in the GoDoc rendering of this package.  While useful, most of these examples are single-minded and are devised to only focus on the particular subject matter at hand.

However this section of the `go-aci` repository allows for contributions related to the `go-aci` package that are larger or more advanced in nature (e.g.: a CLI utility that extends `go-aci` features in a Bash-friendly manner for administrative use).
